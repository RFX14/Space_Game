How to Play:

        Before You Play:
                Make sure you have the JRE(Java Runtime Enviornment) or JDK(Java Development Kit) installed before hand or else you won't be able to play.

        KNOWN ISSUES:
                I think the firing issue from before has sorted itself out
                Sometime the program will drop its frame rate when too many things are on screen
       
        Game Play Thus Far:
                The only thing that can be done is destroy the bunkers using the bullets

        Move side to side using: 
                [A] to move left
                [D] to move right
        Shoot:
                [Shift] to shoot bullets
